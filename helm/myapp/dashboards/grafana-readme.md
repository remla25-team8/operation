# Or specify the number of requests and host
./scripts/test-grafana.sh 50 dev.myapp.local
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Showing in Grafana

1. Verify that the ConfigMap was created:
   ```bash
   kubectl get configmap -n monitoring | grep dashboard
   ```

2. Ensure Grafana has the correct permissions to read ConfigMaps:
   ```bash
   kubectl get clusterrole -n monitoring | grep grafana
   ```

3. Restart the Grafana pod to force it to reload ConfigMaps:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -n monitoring
   ```

### Cannot Access Grafana via Ingress

1. Verify the Ingress is correctly configured:
   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress -n monitoring
   kubectl describe ingress grafana-ingress -n monitoring
   ```

2. Check if the Ingress controller is running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
   ```

3. Try accessing Grafana via NodePort:
   ```bash
   # Get the NodePort
   kubectl get svc -n monitoring | grep grafana
   
   # Access via NodePort
   # http://192.168.56.90:XXXXX
   ```
